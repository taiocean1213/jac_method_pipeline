# JAC Method Pipeline
(AI-generated content using [phind.com](https://www.phind.com/))

This pipeline utilizes the JAC method to analyze data and produce visualizations.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your data in a CSV file with the following columns: 
    - Column 1: Time (in seconds)
    - Column 2: Current (in Amps)
    - Column 3: Voltage (in Volts)
2. Run the pipeline using the following command:
```
python jac_method_pipeline.py data.csv
```
3. The pipeline will output a visualization of the data in a PNG file.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib

## TODOs
1.  create venv (done)
1.  add config file (yaml) for reconstruction parameters  # p=0.5, lamb=0.01, method="kotre", perm=1, jac_normalized=Truep=0.5, lamb=0.01, method="kotre", perm=1, jac_normalized=True
1.  post-process result to extract some quantitative measure (RMSE) of how well did the recon perform 
1.  use mlflow to do different experiment with different config 
1.  add preprocessing step before recon and postprocessing step after recon with configs: any random function would do p=0.5, lamb=0.01, method="kotre", perm=1, jac_normalized=True
1.  build docker containers for each of these steps and orchestrate with Kubernetes
